```
I want to build a svelte icon npm package via rollup and svg plugin. 
I want to achieve dynamic import by icon name. 
I want to be able to transform the svg icons into es module for distribution 
so that consumer app will not need to transform svg icons in the icon library node_modules dist package. I also want to keep the library as simple as possible.
